# Game Project

The main idea of the project is to allow the user to input a game, which will make a request to Steam to display data from Steam. This requires two fetch calls, one to get all games, and then get the ID from the game to make a fetch call for that specific game. An independent fetch with the same game input is made to Twitch, to get the ID and then to get the top streamers. I then would want to query something like isthereanydeal's API.

Meant to mainly learn and apply some testing principles. I intended to only test the initial Form input, as I mainly just wanted to get some familiarity with Jest and intend to mainly focus on Cypress. I ran into issues with somehow being rate-limited or blocked by the Steam API (before storing their result in my own json) due to a test I wrote, which was probably my error.
